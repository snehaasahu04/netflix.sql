# Netflix Platform SQL Project




This project involves building and querying an SQL database for a Netflix-like platform. It includes tracking user subscriptions, monthly revenue, user demographics (age, gender, country), device usage, and more. The goal is to build insightful queries to analyze platform data for decision-making.




## Project Overview

This project simulates the backend database of a Netflix-like platform, where users subscribe to different plans, pay monthly fees, and watch content using various devices. This projectâ€™s objective is to develop SQL queries for:

 1. Analyzing monthly revenue and user behavior

2. Understanding user demographics (age, gender, country)

3. Tracking device usage patterns

4. Payment history and subscription durations

| plan_duration      | INT           | Duration of the subscription plan (in months)   |

## SQL Queries

This project includes a variety of SQL queries that provide insights into the data. Below are the types of queries:

### Beginner Queries

1. **Count the total number of users:**
    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(user_id)
    FROM netflix_userbase;
    ```

2. **List all distinct subscription types:**
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT subscription_type
    FROM netflix_userbase;
    ```

3. **Calculate total revenue from "Basic" subscription users:**
    ```sql
    SELECT SUM(monthly_revenue)
    FROM netflix_userbase
    WHERE subscription_type = 'Basic';
    ```

4. **Find the average age of users:**
    ```sql
    SELECT AVG(Age)
    FROM netflix_userbase;
    ```

5. **List users who joined after January 1, 2022:**
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM netflix_userbase
    WHERE join_date > '2022-01-01';
    ```

### Intermediate Level

1. **Calculate total revenue grouped by country:**
    ```sql
    SELECT Country, SUM(monthly_revenue)
    FROM netflix_userbase
    GROUP BY Country;
    ```

2. **Find average revenue per subscription type:**
    ```sql
    SELECT subscription_type, AVG(monthly_revenue)
    FROM netflix_userbase
    GROUP BY subscription_type;
    ```

3. **Get the number of users with subscription plans lasting more than 1 year:**
    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(user_id)
    FROM netflix_userbase
    WHERE plan_duration > 12;
    ```

4. **Identify the most popular device used by users:**
    ```sql
    SELECT MAX(Device)
    FROM netflix_userbase;
    ```

5. **Identify the most popular device (by count):**
    ```sql
    SELECT Device, COUNT(*) AS Device_Count
    FROM netflix_userbase
    GROUP BY Device
    ORDER BY Device_Count DESC
    LIMIT 1;
    ```

6. **Calculate the percentage of male and female users:**
    ```sql
    SELECT Gender, 
           (COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM netflix_userbase)) AS Gender_Percentage
    FROM netflix_userbase
    GROUP BY Gender;
    ```

### Advanced Level

1. **Find users who haven't made a payment in the last 6 months:**
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM netflix_userbase 
    WHERE LastPaymentDate < DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 6 MONTH);
    ```

2. **List users with "Standard" subscription and older than 30 years:**
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM netflix_userbase 
    WHERE subscription_type = 'Standard' 
    AND Age > 30;
    ```

3. **Rank users by Monthly Revenue within each subscription type:**
    ```sql
    SELECT user_id, subscription_type, monthly_revenue, 
           RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY subscription_type ORDER BY monthly_revenue DESC) AS Revenue_Rank
    FROM netflix_userbase;
    ```

4. **Calculate the average revenue of users per country who joined in 2023:**
    ```sql
    SELECT Country, AVG(monthly_revenue) AS Average_Revenue
    FROM netflix_userbase
    WHERE YEAR(join_date) = 2023
    GROUP BY Country;
    ```

5. **Categorize users into revenue ranges:**
    ```sql
    SELECT 
        CASE 
            WHEN monthly_revenue BETWEEN 0 AND 250 THEN '0 - 250'
            WHEN monthly_revenue BETWEEN 250 AND 500 THEN '250 - 500'
            WHEN monthly_revenue BETWEEN 500 AND 750 THEN '500 - 750'
            ELSE 'Other'
        END AS Revenue_Range, 
        COUNT(*) AS User_Count
    FROM netflix_userbase
    GROUP BY Revenue_Range;
    ```

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have access to the `netflix_userbase` dataset in your database.
2. Run the queries in your SQL client or integrated environment.
3. Modify the queries as needed to match your specific database schema or requirements.
